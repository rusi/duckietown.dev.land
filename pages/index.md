## Message from the mayor of Duckietown

Duckietown is the happiest place on Earth. It is full of playful duckies that love to go places.
The streets are clean and everybody follows the rules. Duckies are generally slow, so they've
discovered the automobile. However, they are not very good drivers.
Fortunately, 132 years ago,
the duckies discovered artificial intelligence and robotics, and invented the self-driving car.
As a result, all cars in Duckietown are autonomous.
